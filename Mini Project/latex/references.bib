  abstract = {Sentiment analysis has proven to be a valuable tool to gauge public opinion in different disciplines. It has been successfully employed in financial market prediction, health issues, customer analytics, commercial valuation assessment, brand marketing, politics, crime prediction, and emergency management. Many of the published studies have focused on sentiment analysis of Twitter messages, mainly because a large and diverse population expresses opinions about almost any topic daily on this platform. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the multifaceted reality of sentiment analysis in social networks. We not only review the existing methods for sentiment analysis in social networks from an academic perspective, but also explore new aspects such as temporal dynamics, causal relationships, and applications in industry. We also study domains where these techniques have been applied, and discuss the practical applicability of emerging Artificial Intelligence methods. This paper emphasizes the importance of temporal characterization and causal effects in sentiment analysis in social networks, and explores their applications in different contexts such as stock market value, politics, and cyberbullying in educational centers. A strong interest from industry in this discipline can be inferred by the intense activity we observe in the field of intellectual protection, with more than 8,000 patents issued on the topic in only five years. This interest compares positively with the effort from academia, with more than 2,300 articles published in 15 years. But these papers are unevenly split across domains: there is a strong presence in marketing, politics, economics, and health, but less activity in other domains such as emergencies. Regarding the techniques employed, traditional techniques such as dictionaries, neural networks, or Support Vector Machines are widely represented. In contrast, we could still not find a comparable representation of advanced state-of-the-art techniques such as Transformers-based systems like BERT, T5, T0++, or GPT-2/3. This reality is consistent with the results found by the authors of this work, where computationally expensive tools such as GPT-3 are challenging to apply to achieve competitive results compared to those from simpler, lighter and more conventional techniques. These results, together with the interest shown by industry and academia, suggest that there is still ample room for research opportunities on domains, techniques and practical applications, and we expect to keep observing a sustained cadence in the number of published papers, patents and commercial tools made available.}

  abstract = {Objective
              The purpose of present review paper is to introduce the reader to key directions of manual, semi-automatic and automatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) severity classification from plain radiographs. This is a narrative review article in which we have described recent developments in severity evaluation of knee OA from X-ray images. We have primarily focussed on automatic analysis and have reviewed articles in which machine learning, transfer learning, active learning, etc. have been employed on X-ray images to access and classify the severity of knee OA.
              Methods
              All original research articles on OA detection and classification using X-ray images published in English were searched on PubMed database, Google Scholar, RSNA radiology databases in year 2019. The search terms of “knee Osteoarthritis” were combined with search terms “Machine Learning”, ‘severity” and “X-ray”.
              Results
              The initial search on various publication databases revealed a total of 743 results, out of which only 26 articles were considered relevant to radiographic knee OA severity analysis. The majority of the articles were based on automatic analysis. Manual segmentation based articles were least in numbers.
              Conclusion
              Computer aided methods to diagnose knee OA are great tools to detect OA at ealry stages. Advancements in Human Computer Interface systems have led the researchers to bridge the gap between machine learning algorithms and expert healthcare professionals to provide better and timely treatment options to the knee OA affected patients.}

As Twitter is a source of a large pool of data, we have used Twitter as our main source of data. We have used some traditional algorithms such as TF-IDF, Bag of Words, Markov Chain, etc., to determine the emotional status of a human being and various psychological effects (Like Anxiety, Stress, Depression, Insecurity, Fear, Panic, etc.) of these long lockdowns. We have also tried to assess the change of mind of the people after the introduction of Covid vaccines. Our system further tries to indicate the need of psychological counseling for people under study based on his/her current mental frame of mind.}

The emphasis is on techniques that are widely used in the discovery of novel compounds in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries with a particular focus on the handling of the large datasets that are now common within these industries. Methods for representing chemical structures in machine-readable format are first introduced before discussion of techniques that enable the storage and retrieval of chemical structures in databases. The focus then shifts to techniques that aim to analyze chemical information in order to derive knowledge that can be used to guide the discovery of new compounds. Virtual screening refers to the selection of compound sets for biological screening, either from in-house databases, from external compound suppliers, or from virtual databases, that is, compound sets that could potentially be synthesized. These techniques are divided into ligand-based virtual screening, which can be used when information about active (and inactive) compounds is available, and structure-based virtual screening in which the three-dimensional structure of the target receptor is used to guide compound selection. Similarity searching and the use of machine learning methods that can be used to derive a model of activity are described as examples of ligand-based virtual screening. Protein–ligand docking is then described as a widely used structure-based virtual screening method. The related concept of diversity analysis is then discussed and the main techniques for selecting diverse subsets of compounds are described. The high attrition rates that are seen in the later stages of drug discovery have led to intense efforts to predict the physicochemical properties of compounds so that undesirable compounds are eliminated from consideration as early as possible. Major efforts in this area are reviewed in the final section of the chapter.}

Periodic beats make up ECG signals, and these beats vary based on the internal dynamics of the cardiovascular system. It is highly challenging to categorize ECG beats that can be understood by specialists in the area. In recent years, attempts have been made to use artificial intelligence programs in conjunction with a database of specified ECG beats to identify autonomous cardiovascular illness. In this investigation, the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database were used to attempt to classify arrhythmias. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) model was used to estimate the arrhythmia classes. The ECG beats defined in the database are divided into five classes: normal (N), supraventricular premature (S), premature ventricular contraction (V), ventricular and normal fusion (F), and Unclassifiable beats (U). The utilized one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN VGG16) model’s average accuracy in classifying arrhythmias was found to be 99.12%. With the aid of this study, a system of experts has been built to assist specialized doctors in the healthcare system. The high estimating success of the used model will help in combining the right diagnosis with the right therapy and saving lives.}

Video Processing, Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Image Classification, Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing are some of the application areas of CNN. Object detection is the most crucial and challenging task of computer vision. It has numerous applications in the field of security, military, transportation and medical sciences. In this review, object detection and its different aspects have been covered in detail. With the gradual increase in the evolution of deep learning algorithms for detecting objects, a significant improvement in the performance of object detection models has been observed. However, this does not imply that the conventional object detection methods, which had been evolving for decades prior to the emergence of deep learning, had become outdated. There are some cases where conventional methods with global features are superior choice. This review paper starts with a quick overview of object detection followed by object detection frameworks, backbone convolutional neural network, and an overview of common datasets along with the evaluation metrics. Object detection problems and applications are also studied in detail. Some future research challenges in designing deep neural networks are discussed. Lastly, the performance of object detection models on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets is compared and conclusions are drawn.}

  abstract = {The great success of social networks is due to their ability to offer Internet users a space of free expression where they can produce a large amount of information which provides every day with a new challenge for data analysts. The ease of use of social media encourages users to increasingly express their opinions either by using simple words expressing feelings or by using irony and sarcasm. The new challenges are to extract and analyze this mass of information which can then be used in different applications such as sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. Sarcasm detection is a subarea of sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and emotion mining which are all representing the process of automatic identification of people’s orientation or sentiment toward individuals, products, services, issues, and events. Sarcasm detection, which is the fact of deciding if a text is ironic or not, could be used, for example, to improve the precision of the sentiment analysis. In most of the existing approaches, sarcasm detection is a binary classification; each text is classified as sarcastic or non-sarcastic; however, since tweets are generally written by humans and humans are by default fuzzy in their emotions and expressions, we can’t 100% confirm that a text is sarcastic or not. In addition, tweets are expressed in natural language which is full of ambiguity and non-precision, which motivates us more to adopt fuzzy logic, not just to detect sarcasm but to give it a score. In this manuscript, we propose a fuzzy sarcasm detection approach using social information such as replies, historical tweets and likes, etc multiplying each by a degree of importance. The evaluation shows that the use of fuzzy logic has led us to improve the precision metric of the classification and to improve the accuracy of our approach. Using degrees of importance gave us the best values for recall, precision, and accuracy measures compared to existing approaches.}
